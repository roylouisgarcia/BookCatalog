# Project 8: Books Catalog App
This is the eight project deliverable for the Android Basic Nanodegree course at Udacity as part of the Grow with Google Scholarship. The goal of this project is to demonstrate and practice the Android data and file storage procedures. For this project, a book catalog will be built using available database manipulation helpers: SQLiteDatabase, Cursors, etc. Also, UI elements such as Spinners, FloatingActionButtons and menus are explored.

### Prerequisites

1. I had been following the lectures to make an interactive android app as part of Udacity's Grow With Google Anroid Basics Nanodegree [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803)
2. Download this repository and use Android Studio IDE to run the project locally via USB connected Android phone or Android Studio's AVD Manager.

### Learning Milestone

At this point, the app demonstrates the learners ability to 
1. Design and Create a database schema
2. Install SQLite on own computer to practice SQL query statements
3. Use Adroid Profiler or the deprecated Android Profiler from the GUI and the command line to export the actual database file created in the emulator
4. Connect to the database, populate the database, and query via various Android UI
5. Understand SQL Injection Risks and best mitigation practices
